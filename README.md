More information on the individual analyses can be found in the `README.md` files provided in subdirectories (e.g. `inversion_detection/README.md`).

Analyses were conducted in the following order:

1. `mito_nuclear_comparison`
2. `inversion_detection`
3. `three_taxon_alignments`
4. `gadidae_time_calibration`
5. `gadidae_phylogenomics`
6. `cod_phylogenomics`
7. `demography`
