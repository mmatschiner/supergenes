# Code repository for analyses conducted in Matschiner et al. (2021)

This code repository is associated with our manuscript entitled "Origin and fate of supergenes in Atlantic cod"<!--, which has been posted to BioRxiv ([]())-->.

More information on the individual analyses can be found in the `README` files provided in subdirectories (e.g. `inversion_detection/README`).

Analyses were conducted in the following order:

1. `mito_nuclear_comparison`
2. `inversion_detection`
3. `three_taxon_alignments`
4. `gadidae_time_calibration`
5. `gadidae_phylogenomics`
6. `cod_phylogenomics`
7. `demography`

Note that the files named `run_all.sh` that can be found in each `src` directory are not intended to be executed, but they specify the order in which all other scripts should be executed.
