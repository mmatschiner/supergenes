Scripts in this directory analyze divergence times and introgression
among cod populations with SNAPP and Dsuite, separately within and
outside of supergenes. Divergence times are also estimated in sliding
windows of 250 kb across all chromosomes. Finally, ancestry painting
is used to illustrate introgression (through double crossover) into
specimens sampled at Bornholm Basin.
