The analyses in this directory were performed to test the claim by
Arnason and Halldorsdottir (2019) that arctogadus glacialis is some
sort of hybrid species. The results in directory res/iqtree show that
when alignments are based on local assembly instead of mapping to the
cod reference as in A&H, mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies are
fully concordant. The sample used by A&H is in both phylogenies
closest to Trisopterus minutus, as would be expected if the sample was
not in fact an Arctogadus but instead a blue whiting (Micromesistius
poutassou), as also suggested by 100% identical mitochondrial genome
of the blue whiting (A&H).
