The xml file was prepared manually with beauti.
Of the alignments in ../../res/alignments/12, four
alignments were excluded due to poor convergence of
the gene trees of these alignments in preliminary
analyses. These alignments are:
ENSDARG00000003189
ENSDARG00000017034
ENSDARG00000059963
ENSDARG00000062269

Age constraints are based on Musilova et al. (2019).
