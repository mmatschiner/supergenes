Scripts in this directory generate a multi-marker phylogeny of Gadidae
including the two species Gadus ogac and Gadus macrocephalus that were
not included in Malmstr√∏m et al. 2016. This phylogeny is constructed
using StarBEAST2, based on two age constraints from Musilova et al.
(2019).

Two separate subdirectories are included in this directory, for
ortholog detection and phylogenetic inference. Of these scripts in
subdirectory ortholog_detection should be executed before those in
phylogenetic_inference.
