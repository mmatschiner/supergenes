File exons.fasta contains amino-acid sequences for zebrafish exons
used as queries in ortholog detection in Roth et al. (2020).
Files gadmor_exons.fasta and gadmor_exons_nucl.fasta contain amino-
acid and nucleotide sequences, respectively, identified as homologs
to the zebrafish queries in Roth et al. (2020).
