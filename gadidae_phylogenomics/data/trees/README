91genes_species.tre is the species tree resulting from the
StarBEAST2 analysis in the gadidae_time_calibration pipeline.

91genes_species_pruned.tre was manually generated by removing
brobro_spc, gadarg_spc, and trimin_spc from 91genes_species.tre.

91genes_species_pruned_notranslate.tre is identical to 
91genes_species_pruned.tre but does not contain a translate
block.

aim_species_simple_ladder_1_nwk.tre is the tree with highest
support from the AIM analysis in this directory.
