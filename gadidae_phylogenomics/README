Scripts in this directory analyze divergence times and introgression
among species within Gadinae using AIM and a dataset composed of
alignments that are generated from a genome-wide SNP set in
combination with the reference genome. Additionally, D-statistics are
calculated from genome-wide SNPs with Dsuite, and introgression
patterns are further investigated with tree-based introgression tests.
