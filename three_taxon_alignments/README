Scripts in this directory use assembly and read data to build a 
three-way whole-genome alignment for gadMor2, gadMor_Stat, and melAeg.
Based on the consistency between different version of this alignment
built with three different approaches, a mask is generated to exclude
unreliable alignment sites in downstream analyses.

The three-way whole-genome alignment, together with the gadMor2
annotation, is further used to analyze mutation load and to identify
differences in vitellogenin genes.
